## Basic Git commands (using Git Bash):
Before making changes:
* `git pull` - Pull remote changes if there is any.

After making changes:
* `git status` - To view local file changes.
* `git add -A` - Track all file changes in the repository.
* `git commit -m "[message]"` - Commit local changes with a comment
* `git push` - Push changes to the remote repository.

## Note:
* Save Matlab files as .m so that we can view changes in browser without having to download file and launch Matlab. 
* Remember to change file extension to .mlx when submitting.
